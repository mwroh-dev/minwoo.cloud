## Can Adversity Enhance Creativity?
I sometimes watch science-related YouTube videos, and today, I came across an interesting discussion in a neuroscience video.

> Can adversity enhance creativity? In psychology, the concept of post-traumatic growth suggests that overcoming struggles leads to a deeper understanding of oneself and the world, often resulting in a shift in values and perspectives. The process of breaking down and rebuilding can foster positive psychological growth, which, in turn, enhances creative abilities.

This resonated with me.
I can't share my entire life story here, but I want to briefly talk about a moment when I tried to turn adversity into an opportunity.

## Feeling Lost as a Junior Developer
When I first started working as a developer at a small startup, I often felt like I was struggling to keep up. About eight months after launching the product, I found myself feeling lost.

> I'm a developer now, but what exactly should I be doing?

Today, there are plenty of seminars, tech meetups, boot camps, and courses available in South Korea. But back then, resources werenâ€™t as easily accessible. I felt stuck. One day, I came across an announcement: A well-known tech company in Korea was launching its first-ever internship program.

I didnâ€™t hesitateâ€”I applied. But when I took the technical test, I realized I was facing problems I had never encountered before.
Unsurprisingly, I didnâ€™t make it.

## The Disappointment of Missing an Opportunity
The rejection itself was disappointing, but what made it harder was knowing what I had missed out on.

This wasnâ€™t just a typical internshipâ€”

- Senior developer mentoring
- Hands-on experience with real projects
- Pair programming sessions

I knew these were invaluable opportunities, and missing out felt like a real setback.
Then, something unexpected happened.
The rejection email was sent out, but due to an internal mistake, every applicantâ€™s email address was exposed in the CC field instead of being hidden in BCC.
Shortly after, the companyâ€™s CTO sent out an apology email for the data breach.
At that moment, a thought crossed my mind:

> Maybe I should reach out to the CTO. Even a single piece of advice could help me figure out my next steps.

## The Email That Started It All
So, I decided to write an email to the CTO.

```
ðŸ“© June 11, 2017 (Sunday) 5:37 PM
Hello OOO CTO,
My name is Minwoo Roh, and I recently applied for the internship program.

I originally hoped to meet you in person through the internship and
ask for advice as a junior developer. Since I didnâ€™t pass the test,
I thought Iâ€™d reach out via email instead. ðŸ˜Š

I havenâ€™t been a developer for long.
I started working at a travel startup and built a React Native app.

...

My question is:
"As a frontend developer,
where should I focus to truly grow and build great software?"

I know I still have a lot to learn.
Should I dig deeper into the React ecosystem,
or should I broaden my understanding of core programming concepts?

I realize youâ€™re busy, so I donâ€™t want to take up too much of your time.
But if you could share even a brief piece of advice,
I would be truly grateful. ðŸ˜Š
```

## An Unexpected Invitation
At first, I was hopeful that I might get a reply. But three days passed, and there was no response.

"Of course, they must be busy."

Then, out of nowhere, I received an email
> ðŸ“© The CTO has received your message. After reviewing it internally, we'd like to invite you to our office to discuss your questions. If you'd like, we can also arrange a coffee chat with our Frontend Lead.


I was genuinely surprised. I had only expected a short reply, yet I was being invited to their office.

## The One Sentence That Changed My Perspective
I wanted to make the most of this opportunity.
So, when I met the Frontend Lead, I asked a question that had been on my mind for a long time:

> "Frontend technologies evolve so quicklyâ€”how do you keep up?"

His answer completely changed the way I approach learning.

> Frontend is like an onion. If you keep peeling layer after layer without direction, you might never reach the core. Instead of chasing every new trend, focus on understanding why a technology was created and what problem it solves. In the end, you need to define your own criteria for learning and understanding technology.

This perspective shift had a profound impact on me.
Every new technology emerges because it solves a specific problem in an existing system.
Since then, whenever I study something new, I always ask myself:

> What problem led to this innovation?

## Taking the Next Step
After the meeting, the company kindly gave me some of their branded merchandise, and I sent a thank-you email before heading home.

Looking back, this experience wasnâ€™t just about learning technical skillsâ€”it was about how we navigate challenges and create opportunities.
Even now, with AI and new tools reshaping the industry, I often find myself questioning:

- What kind of developer should I become?
- What should I focus on?
- Am I heading in the right direction?

But Iâ€™ve come to realize that uncertainty will always exist.
What truly matters is how we choose to respond and what steps we take next.
Recently, I saw a post on LinkedIn that resonated with me:

> Rather than hesitating, just take action. More often than not, itâ€™s worth it.

opportunitiesâ€”lay the foundation, keep learning, and watch efforts grow into something meaningful.
